# FORNOW: I will run an analysis excluding these people as an experiment to see how it goes. TOMORROW I will investigate who they are further




# also need to investigate the NA's:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
```


## Look at who has the arrival and departure times as NA

Extract the pid's where arrival and departure times are NA
```{r}
pids_na_arr_dep <- travel_dat %>% gather(key = "key", value = "value", -pid) %>% 
  filter(is.na(value)) %>% .$pid %>% unique
```

Read the raw CHTS files
```{r}

```


## Look at the code itself


# check for start/end time consistency

# investigate to make sure all start at time 1, end at time 1439 vs 1440

# NA'S in the middle?
