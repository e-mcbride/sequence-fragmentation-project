FOR NOW: I will run an analysis excluding these people as an experiment to see how it goes. TOMORROW I will investigate who they are further


```{r}
travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
```

# investigate the NA's:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
```


## Look at who has the arrival and departure times as NA

Extract the pid's where any time value is NA
```{r}
pids_na_arr_dep <- travel_dat %>% 
  select(pid, arr_time3_add1, dep_time3_add1) %>%
  gather(key = "key", value = "value", -pid) %>% 
  filter(is.na(value)) %>% 
  .$pid %>% unique
```




Read the raw CHTS files, extract place file
```{r}
# chts <- read_rds(here("data-raw", "chts_all_2019-05-22.rds"))
chts <- read_rds(here("data-raw", "chts_all_2019-06-18.rds")) # new fixed up one!
place <- chts$PLACE
```

Extract the rows with pids that have NA's for their arr/dep times
```{r}
library(magrittr)
place %<>% mutate(pid = str_c(SAMPN, PERNO, sep = "") %>% as.numeric())

pl_na <- place %>% filter(pid %in% pids_na_arr_dep) %>% select(source, pid, PLANO, ARR_HR, ARR_MIN, DEP_HR, DEP_MIN, ARRTM, DEPTM)

```


Below, checking to see what arrival/departure times exist for PLANO == 1 in whole sample, and comparing to arr/dep times in `pl_na`

```{r}
pl1 <- place %>% filter(PLANO == 1) %>% select(source,pid, PLANO, ARR_HR, ARR_MIN, ARRTM)

pl1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(ARRTM)) %>% 
  .$ARRTM %>% 
  # unique %>% 
  View()

pl1 %>%
  filter(is.na(ARR_HR)) %>% 
  # .$ARRTM %>% 
  # unique %>% 
  View()

pl_na %>% filter(PLANO == 1) %>% 
  # select(pid, PLANO, ARR_HR, ARR_MIN, ARRTM) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(ARRTM)) %>% 
  .$ARRTM %>% 
  # unique %>% 
  View

```


All the people whose PLANO == 1, but arrival time is NOT NA are included in `pl_na`.

SRBI coded NA's for PLANO == 1, Nustats coded 3:00am for PLANO == 1. 

HOWEVER, Many of their PLANO == 1 have an ARRTM = NA. (correct formatting). So who are those people and why did they get NA's? I may need to move on to looking at the code itself for a bit. 


qUICK Question: how many people (unique pids) srbi vs nustats?
```{r}
per <- chts$PERSON
per %>% group_by(source) %>% count
```

There are 8080 in srbi, 109113 in nustats. And there are 8061 from srbi in the place file (the exact amount from srbi that are in the NA's)

How many of the na pids are from each?
```{r}
per %>% mutate(pid = str_c(SAMPN, PERNO)) %>% 
  filter(pid %in% pids_na_arr_dep) %>% 
  group_by(source) %>% count
```
ONLY 1 FROM NUSTATS, AND 8061 FROM SRBI.
WARNING: THIS MEANS I NEED TO LOOK AT THE START TIMES

who is the 1 from nustats:
```{r}
place %>%
  filter(pid %in% pids_na_arr_dep) %>% 
  filter(source == "NuStats") %>% View()
```


## Look at the code itself

### check modified place file
Compare `arrival_time_3` to `arr_time3_add1` (and the same for departure time)

Created in "02_modify-place-file.R"

```{r}
pl_mod <- read_rds(here("data","modified_pldat.rds"))
```

```{r}
pl_wat <- pl_mod %>% 
  select(pid, PLANO, arrival_time_3, arr_time3_add1, departure_time_3, dep_time3_add1) %>% 
  filter(is.na(arr_time3_add1))
```



### Check the creation of arrival_time_3

Apparently, the arrival/departure times should NOT be NA'S. They should be 0's. Going back to the creation of the arrival and departure times in this format. This is in the script `01_03_time-in-min-since-3am.R`

Below is the code from that script:
```{r}
convert_time_3A <- function(ext_time_col) {
  t3 = ext_time_col - 180
  if_else(t3 < 0, t3 + 24*60, t3)
}
```

```{r}
locations_timevars <- place %>% 
  mutate(arrival_time_3   = convert_time_3A(ARR_HR * 60 + ARR_MIN),
         departure_time_3 = convert_time_3A(DEP_HR * 60 + DEP_MIN),
         place_duration   = departure_time_3 - arrival_time_3 + 1,
         trip_duration    = TRIPDUR) # %>% select(SAMPN,PERNO,PLANO, arrival_time_3, departure_time_3, place_duration)
```

```{r}
x <- locations_timevars %>% select(pid,PLANO, ARR_HR, ARR_MIN, arrival_time_3, DEP_HR, DEP_MIN, departure_time_3, place_duration) %>% mutate(arrhr_min = ARR_HR *60)
```

### SRBI vs NUSTATS
what does srbi look like?
```{r}
srbi_place <- place %>% filter(source == "SRBI")
```

```{r}
activity <- chts$ACTIVITY
srbi_act <- activity %>% filter(source == "SRBI")
```

```{r}
srbi_arr_dep_times <- srbi_act %>% select(SAMPN, PERNO, PLANO, ARRTM, DEPTM) %>% distinct()
```


What I need to do: 
Get arrival/departure times from activity file from SRBI, divide by 60 to get the numbers we need, put that into the time-in-min-since-3am file. Could do an if/else statement.
```{r}
srbi_arr_dep_times <- srbi_act %>% 
  select(SAMPN, PERNO, PLANO, ARRTM, DEPTM) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(arr_hr = ARRTM%/%3600,
         arr_min = (ARRTM/60)%%60,
         dep_hr = DEPTM%/%3600,
         dep_min = (DEPTM/60)%%60)
```










# NA'S in the middle?
```{r}
x <- pl_na %>% filter(#ARRTM == "Refused" | 
                        #ARRTM == "Don�t know"| 
                        #DEPTM == "Refused" | 
                        #DEPTM == "Don�t know"| 
                        DEPTM == "Did not leave location") %>% 
  .$pid %>% 
  unique()
pl_na %>% filter(pid %in% x) %>% View


z <- pl_na %>% mutate(badguy = ARRTM == "Refused"| ARRTM == "Don�t know")


```

```{r}
pl_na$ARRTM %>% unique()
```

```{r}
z <- pl_na %>% mutate(badguy = ARRTM == "Refused"| ARRTM == "Don�t know")


```

```{r}
pl_na$ARRTM %>% unique()
```


# fix the ppl who didn't leave the house from SRBI
do they still have NA for their departure time? NOPE they're all good


find them by saying: if plano == 1 and lastplace == T

```{r}
library(here);library(tidyverse)
chts <- read_rds(here("data-raw", "chts_all_2019-06-18.rds")) # new fixed up one!
place <- chts$PLACE
library(magrittr)
place %<>% mutate(pid = str_c(SAMPN, PERNO, sep = "") %>% as.numeric())
# travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
```

```{r}
pl <- place %>% 
  group_by(SAMPN, PERNO) %>% 
  mutate(lastplace = (PLANO == max(PLANO))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(source, SAMPN, PERNO, PLANO, lastplace, ARR_HR, ARR_MIN, DEP_HR, DEP_MIN)
```

```{r}
stayhome <- pl %>% filter(lastplace & PLANO == 1)
```

```{r}
rm(stayhome, pl)
```


# check for start/end time consistency

I will be using the "fixed" sample (made in `02_modify-place-file.R`) 

Make sure all start at time 1, end at time 1439 vs 1440
```{r}
library(here);library(magrittr);library(tidyverse)
# chts <- read_rds(here("data-raw", "chts_all_2019-06-18.rds")) # new fixed up one!
# place <- chts$PLACE

# place %<>% mutate(pid = str_c(SAMPN, PERNO, sep = "") %>% as.numeric())
# travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
pl_mod <- read_rds(here("data","modified_pldat.rds")) 
```

```{r}
startendtimes <- pl_mod %>% 
  group_by(SAMPN, PERNO) %>% 
  mutate(firstplace = PLANO == min(PLANO),
         lastplace = PLANO == max(PLANO)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(source, pid, SAMPN, PERNO, PLANO, arr_time3_add1, dep_time3_add1, firstplace, lastplace)

place1_timenot1 <- startendtimes %>% filter(PLANO == 1 & arr_time3_add1 > 1)

```

```{r}
pid_plano1_badarr <- place1_timenot1$pid %>% unique()
```


Do the travel rows add the missing info?
```{r}
travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))

x <- travel_dat %>% filter(pid %in% pid_plano1_badarr)
```
NO it does not. it starts from the next place.


Are the last place times 1440?
```{r}
lastpl_timenot1440 <- startendtimes %>% filter(lastplace & dep_time3_add1 < 1438)
pid_plano1_baddep <- lastpl_timenot1440$pid %>% unique
```
THERE ARE 89 PEOPLE WITH DEPARTURE TIMES EARLIER THAN 1439

Do the travel rows add the missing departure info?
```{r}
y <- travel_dat %>% filter(pid %in% pid_plano1_badarr) %>% arrange(pid, dep_time3_add1)
```
NO it does not.

# check that arrival times come before departure times

```{r}
library(here);library(magrittr);library(tidyverse)
# chts <- read_rds(here("data-raw", "chts_all_2019-06-18.rds")) # new fixed up one!
# place <- chts$PLACE

# place %<>% mutate(pid = str_c(SAMPN, PERNO, sep = "") %>% as.numeric())
# travel_dat <- read_rds(here("data", "places_travel-added.rds"))
pl_mod <- read_rds(here("data","modified_pldat.rds")) 
```

```{r}
badsequences <- pl_mod %>% 
  mutate(badseq = dep_time3_add1 - arr_time3_add1) %>% 
  select(source,pid, PLANO, arr_time3_add1, dep_time3_add1, badseq) %>% 
  filter(badseq < 1) 

badseq_pid <-  badsequences %>%  .$pid %>% unique()

```

Are zero's ok? I think it has to be at least 1?

902 with zeros or negative. could it be my fault? Check the activity file processing

compare my current arrival times to the arrival times from the activity file. make sure they match up


# Total complete households vs with incomplete households, same for people after removing the bad guys in both ways
Both ways means removing whole households vs not removing whole households



# WHO is in `pl_na`

Here is what I have figured out:

* All the people whose PLANO == 1, but arrival time is NOT NA are included in `pl_na`.
* Apparently, the arrival/departure times should NOT be NA'S. They should be 0's.
* There are 8080 in srbi, 109113 in nustats. And there are 8061 from srbi in the place file (the exact amount from srbi that are in the NA's)


* after fixing the issues with the timing variables from SRBI, we have 985 pids left who have na's in their arrival/departure times
* 809 respondents from SRBI said "refused" or "don't know" for at least 1 of the time responses for a place they went/activity they did 
* People who said "did not leave location" 


* after removing the 985 people:
* THERE ARE 19 PEOPLE with place ==1 but start time is NOT 1. Missing time (all from srbi)
* THERE ARE 89 PEOPLE WITH DEPARTURE TIMES EARLIER THAN 1439

* manual removal pids:
  + 1275701 (arrival times are not before departure times)
