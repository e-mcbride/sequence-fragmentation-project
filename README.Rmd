A project examining activity and travel fragmentation in California.

# Overview

The primary goal of this project is to investigate the effects of activity and travel fragmentation on behavior. The current focus of the project is to reorganize and update the previous data analysis scripts. This will allow for future use of this workflow in larger-scale implementation of the analysis.

## Useful links:

* [Integrating git and Github into an R project](https://happygitwithr.com/)
* Restructuring principles I will be using can be found in the article [project-oriented workflow.](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)


## Restructuring of scripts

We want the project workflow to:

* Have a clear organizational scheme
* Have each script be one piece (break down the workflow into small pieces that are each in their own script)
* Bring over all necessary pieces from the old scripts to the new ones. 



TIPS FOR MYSELF (directly from the article [project-oriented workflow.](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)
)

1. Isolate code that creates an object that takes a long time to create in its own script.
2. Write the object to file as `.rds` 
3. Scripts developed downstream can just reload the object 



I will also be using something relatively new to me: the `here` package. This makes relative path structures much more flexible and is meant to be used within an R project. More info on that can be found [here.](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)


Eventual goals:

* Bring Adam's scripts that built the objects I am using into the project. 


# Project structure (folders, etc)

* `/R` contains scripts
* `/figs` contains any figures built
* `/data` contains the data files we will use and access. Right now, this includes those. However, I am ocnsidering moving the mid-stream files to their own folder. 
* `/results` contains any files that are a final result in themselves, but are not explicitly figures. This would include things like .csv's 

Undecided if I will be uploading the folders `/data` and `/results` to GitHub. I need to learn what the best way to deal with data in projects is.


## Flow of the Analysis

Run [R/95_make-all.R](R/95_make-all.R) to re-run the analysis and re-render this README.

# Notes

I believe the order of the previous scripts is as follows:

1. "ExtractActivitySequence_SLOSB.Rmd"
2. "FirstTraMineR_Exploration.Rmd"
3. "IATBR18analysis.Rmd"
4. "TRB2019_Regression_etc.Rmd"


## List of files built that idk if I need (check whether we read them in later scripts)

From `"01_extract-chts-slosb-activity..."`

* `slo_sb_hhids.rds`

### Place type
```{r, include = FALSE}
pltype_frq <- readr::read_csv(here::here("figs","place-type-freq-table-HOSW.csv"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pltype_frq %>% 
  knitr::kable()
