# sequence-fragmentation-project
GeoTrans project looking at fragmentation using sequence analysis

Testing a line addition from RStudio.

[Integrating git and Github into an R project](https://happygitwithr.com/)

My goals for this reorganization of the project are for it to flow well, have an organizational scheme, have each script be one piece (break down the workflow into small pieces that are each in their own script. 

Principles I will be using can be found in the article [Project-oriented workflow.](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)


I will also be using something relatively new to me - the `here` package. This makes relative path structures much more flexible and is meant to be used within an R project. More info on that can be found [here.](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)
